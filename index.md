### Research Interests

My main research interests are polar climate and natural variability. In particular I am interested in solar influence on weather and climate.

My current research is targeted at improving understanding of the vertical temperature and wind response to the 11-year solar cycle, and associated mechanisms. Relating to this, I am also working to understand the importance and application of different statistical methods in this area of attribution. My past research has also focused on sea-ice variability and examining and quantifying the influence of solar forcing on regional sea-ice conditions.
